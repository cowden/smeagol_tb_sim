# Geant4 Based Simulations

This is may Geant4 playground which is primarily intended to host
detector simulations I can use to explore and develop smeagol.

# Visualization

# Data Collection

# Setup
Source the `scripts/setup.sh` script to prepare a working environment to
compile the simulations.

# Geometries
The following simulation executables implement various geometries and
scenarios to study.  Some of these may leverage common code in the
`include` and `src` directories.
